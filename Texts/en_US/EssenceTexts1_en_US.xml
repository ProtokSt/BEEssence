You will also find some alien ruins that will provide us with culture and research when investigating the operation of the facility abandoned years ago.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Land is more interesting than sea, city near rivers can build the especial building "Dam" too, in compensation, aquatic bases give more culture (+50%) and have big bonuses for creating aquatic units but they are 20% easier to destroy.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]When a a city is conquered, the local population will be discontented. This discontent manifests itself in the "Martial Law" phase. The length of this phase depends on how much population has the city.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]If you want the revolts phase in the conquered cities, you need to became the city a "Puppet" but it will be automanaged (can be taken the control later) or "Raze" the city but the city will be full destroyed.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Repairing a unit per turn is +10 HP on enemy or neutral territory, +20HP on friendly territory, +30 HP inside a city. Miasma reduce -10HP to the unit in the tile except for alien units that health them +10HP per turn.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Units in a Swamp have an additional movement cost and lows attack (-10%), Hills provide 25% defensive bonuses, Forests hinder movement, and Rivers can create choke points (-40% penalty to attack) and flanking attack bonus of 10%.Units attack output is reduced by the same percentage of damaged unit.
